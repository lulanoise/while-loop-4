# Exercise: While Loop 4
* you have an int called `number`
* the user has to guess the value of `number`
* the program:
  * starts welcoming the user `Welcome!`
  * creates a random number (`1 <= number <= 10`) and assigns it to `number`
  * then it asks the user to guess the number
* the program stops with a `Congratulations!` when the user enters the right value
